#### **Bug notice:** If you can't create new detectors in the Preferences dialog...

Older versions of DTSA-II stored the descriptions of x-ray detectors in a format which is incompatible with the later releases. This can manifest itself as no detectors present in the Preferences dialog and/or an inability to add new detectors. The quick fix is to delete the DTSA-II database. You can find out where the database is located by opening the Preferences dialog and looking for "Base report path" on the "User Information" page. The database is located in the "Database v2" folder within the "Base report path." Delete the "Database v2" folder and restart DTSA-II. The database will be recreated. You should find one default Instrument called "Probe" with one default detector "Detector - Si(Li)". You will now be able to define new detectors.

You may want to record the properties of your detectors before upgrading to ensure that you can reproduce them after deleting the database.
